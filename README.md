## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

**Transition Effects**: I explored the use of CSS transitions to create smooth animations when certain properties change, such as background color, text color, and border color. This helped to enhance the user interaction and provide visual feedback.

```css
.button-sedans,
.button-suvs,
.button-luxury {
  transition: background-color 0.3s, color 0.3s, border-color 0.3s;
}
```

### Continued development

1. **CSS Animations and Transitions**: I found CSS animations and transitions to be a great way to add interactivity and enhance the user experience. I want to continue exploring more advanced animation techniques, such as keyframes and transform properties, to create even more engaging and dynamic effects.

2. **JavaScript Interactions**: Although this project focused more on the design aspects, I want to delve deeper into JavaScript to add more interactive functionalities to my future projects. This includes event handling, DOM manipulation, and working with APIs to create more dynamic and data-driven web applications.
